    "## Summary and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### What was done:\n",
    "1. ✅ Loaded CSV data containing artist information\n",
    "2. ✅ Extracted unique artist names with their royalty rates\n",
    "3. ✅ Cleaned and validated data\n",
    "4. ✅ Mapped CSV columns to API field names:\n",
    "   - `Artist` → `artist_name`\n",
    "   - `Artist Royalty - Retail` → `artist_royalties_retail`\n",
    "   - `Artist Royalty - Wholesale` → `artist_royalties_wholesale`\n",
    "   - `Artist Royalty - Interiors` → `artist_royalties_interiors`\n",
    "5. ✅ Uploaded artists to Strapi API with error handling and logging\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- Robust error handling for network issues and API errors\n",
    "- Comprehensive logging for tracking progress\n",
    "- Environment variables for sensitive credentials\n",
    "- Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming the API\n",
    "- Detailed success/failure reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvements:\n",
    "1. **Duplicate checking**: Query existing artists before upload to avoid duplicates\n",
    "2. **Batch operations**: If API supports it, batch uploads for better performance\n",
    "3. **Retry logic**: Implement automatic retry for failed uploads\n",
    "4. **Data validation**: Add pre-upload validation for royalty rate ranges\n",
    "5. **Update capability**: Add logic to update existing artists instead of only creating new ones\n",
    "6. **Export results**: Save upload results to a CSV file for record-keeping"
