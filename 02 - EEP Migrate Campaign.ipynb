    "## Summary and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### What was done:\n",
    "1. ✅ Loaded CSV data containing campaign information\n",
    "2. ✅ Extracted unique campaign names with their launch dates\n",
    "3. ✅ Cleaned and validated data (removed nulls and empty values)\n",
    "4. ✅ Converted dates to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) required by Strapi\n",
    "5. ✅ Mapped CSV columns to API field names:\n",
    "   - `EEP Campaign Name` → `campaign_name`\n",
    "   - `EEP Campaign Launch Date` → `campaign_launch_date`\n",
    "6. ✅ Uploaded campaigns to Strapi API with error handling and logging\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- Robust error handling for network issues and API errors\n",
    "- Date parsing to handle various date formats\n",
    "- Comprehensive logging for tracking progress\n",
    "- Environment variables for sensitive credentials\n",
    "- Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming the API\n",
    "- Detailed success/failure reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Notes:\n",
    "- Grouped by campaign name to get unique campaigns\n",
    "- Handled campaigns with missing launch dates (set to null)\n",
    "- Validated date formats and converted to ISO 8601 standard\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvements:\n",
    "1. **Duplicate checking**: Query existing campaigns before upload to avoid duplicates\n",
    "2. **Update capability**: Add logic to update existing campaigns instead of only creating new ones\n",
    "3. **Batch operations**: If API supports it, batch uploads for better performance\n",
    "4. **Retry logic**: Implement automatic retry for failed uploads with exponential backoff\n",
    "5. **Data validation**: Add pre-upload validation for campaign names (length, special characters, etc.)\n",
    "6. **Export results**: Save upload results to a CSV file for record-keeping\n",
    "7. **Date validation**: Add validation for future dates or unrealistic date ranges"
